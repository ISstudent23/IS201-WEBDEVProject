        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The Roma make up the largest ethnic group in Europe, with 10-12 million spread throughout Europe. Though considered citizens in their respective countries of residence, Roma children nonetheless experience many educational disparities. The impoverished circumstances of many Roma families leads to less access to foundational education services, which puts children entering the school system at a disadvantage. Once in school, unofficial segregation practices lead to further disadvantages in learning opportunities and improvement. In educational situations the government adds its own hinderances with documentational requirements and a lack of involvement in Roma inclusion practices. What results is low levels of enrollment and retention of Roma students, which leads to incomplete school experience and leaves children lacking in fundamental skills and knowledge. Poor educational achievement is a problem which hinders progression of Roma children to higher education and integration into the labor market. Effective practices for improving these disparities include ending segregation through cultural awareness and specific community by community inclusion strategies and well as ensuring high quality education by training teachers and fostering a better home and school relationship.</p>
